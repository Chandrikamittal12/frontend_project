            <p>A Love Letter to Nature


                Every time I paint scenes of nature, my heart is leading the way. Every careful brush stroke imitating a leaf or every wistful gesture of blue depicting vast sky feels like I’m telling the world of nature, “I love you.” I would not feel the need to say more than that, other than this is a blog and a mere two sentences seems inadequate to post, so I will find the words to further express myself. 
                
                <br>
                I love nature more than most things in life, and trees are my favorite. I love to stare at the branches overhead and map their skyward paths. I love the smell of trees. I love the colors. It whisks me a way to a happier place where for an imaginary moment every person on earth appreciates the beauty around them. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Even when I am in the heart of downtown, nature’s atmosphere hangs overhead with an array of vibrant clouds and lights. When I feel enclosed, I can look up past the skyscrapers to see a pallet of blues, violets, oranges, and pinks, like the earth painted a picture just for me. 
                
                <br>
                Below me, between the cracks in the pavement or gaps in the brick, springs the most beautiful weeds. They are small but determined, drawing life from meager sweepings of soil. Their colors can be almost dizzying in the right time of day, blazing green and blue against dull concrete. I love those little weeds more than I can say. I empathize with these sprigs of nature, as I also am fighting to make a life for myself with the few resources I have. I give the lively weeds an adoring glance as I carefully step over them, never wanting to discourage their growth.
                
                <br>
                There is no lesson, no point to this article. Just a written love letter about nature and how it cares for my soul. If I had to state some kind of take away from these thoughts, I would simply encourage everyone to pause and notice the beauty around you. 
                <br>
                
                Life can be so stressful and consuming. And in my recent experience, the journeys we are all on can sometimes take more than they give. Sometimes I am left wondering if there is anything left that is worth fighting for. I am left discouraged, with little money remaining to “treat myself” to a pick me up. But then I look out that window and, wow… there's a lot of expensive things in life, but that view of the sunset is priceless. All I know is life is difficult and demanding, and encouragement can be hard to come by. But it is free and easy to simply looking around and relishing the beauty of the natural earth, even if that beauty is small and growing in a sidewalk crack.
